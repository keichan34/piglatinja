Overrides the current language and translates all messages into nonsensical Japanese characters.

== Description ==

Overrides the current language and translates all messages into nonsensical Japanese characters. This way you can easily see what strings might look like in a full-width character locale.

Also gives you an idea of what happens when a long string may break the layout of your theme / plugin.

Based on [Pig Latin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/piglatin/)
